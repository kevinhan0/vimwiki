#  Odds Ratio and Log Odds Ratio

* An odds ratio is a statistic that ::quantifies the strength of the association:: between two events, A and B.
* The ratio of the odds of A in the ::presence:: of B and the odds of A in the ::absence:: of B, or equivalently the vice versa.
* Two events are ::independent:: iff the ::OR equals 1::, i.e., the odds of one event are the same in either the presence or absence of the other event.
* OR > 1: A and B are ::associated:: (correlated) in the sense that, compared to the absence of B, the presence of B raises the odds of A, and the other way around.
* OR < 1: A and B are ::negatively correlated::, and the presence of one event reduces the odds of the other event.
* Taking the logarithm of the odds ratio transforms the odds ratio into a normal distribution.
