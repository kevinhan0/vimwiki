# Central Limit Theorem
	* A population follows an ::unknown distribution:: with `σ^2 < ∞`.
	* We draw `N` ::random and independent:: samples of size `n`, i.e., `X={x_1, x_2, ..., x_N}`.
	* According to the CLT, the sampling distribution follows a Normal distribution with mean `μ` and standard deviation `σ/√n`, where `μ` and `σ` are the population mean and variance.

### Implications

	* CLT is useful for estimating the mean and variance of a large population.
	* It is also important for many statistical tests with normality assumptions such as the t-test.
	* CLT can also be used to calculate confidence intervals.
	* A typical sample size is ::no less than 30::.
